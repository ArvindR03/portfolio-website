## Summary

I worked in conjunction with the design team to create a module that would extract metadata from media, to conditionally and efficiently render videos and photos in-app for 30+ million iOS users.

The module was built with AVFoundation in UIKit, and will be used across the whole app in development to render videos and photos based on the metadata that the Design team add.

## Key Skills

My key skills / improvements from the internship were:

üíª **Swift + UIKit Development** - this was my first time ever working in Swift, and I tackled complex memory and concurrency topics daily in order to build my module.

‚öôÔ∏è **Large Scale App Development** - I learned so much about how to develop software at scale, proper conduct for code reviews and CI/CD, and it was very insightful to see what goes into maintaining a globally scaled app.

ü§ù **Cross-Department Collaboration** - my work involved close collaboration with the design team, and I went out of my way to help people in other projects e.g. people working with SQL in Operations. I was able to effectively integrate myself into my team to aid efficiency.
